Reading up on Django functionality in order to determine whether Django or Flask is better usable for this project.

Django is still too mysterious to me. I cannot grasp it's functionality by just reading up on it. Without proper lecture and someone to show me the basics I won't understand it before I run out of time for this project. 
Therefore the choice has been made to use FLask as a Framework, since I've worked with it before. It was a long time ago so today I'll try and set up a very simple website to see if I remember how it works.

After some procrastination finally busy in setting up Flask and the database.
I have no clue how any of it works so reading up on basic Flask setup and SQLalchemy.
