Reading up on Django functionality in order to determine whether Django or Flask is better usable for this project.

*24-02-2021*

Django is still too mysterious to me. I cannot grasp it's functionality by just reading up on it. Without proper lecture and someone to show me the basics I won't understand it before I run out of time for this project. 
Therefore the choice has been made to use FLask as a Framework, since I've worked with it before. It was a long time ago so today I'll try and set up a very simple website to see if I remember how it works.

After some procrastination finally busy in setting up Flask and the database.
I have no clue how any of it works so reading up on basic Flask setup and SQLalchemy.

*01-03-2021 - 08-03-2021*

Added html for index and login. log in does not work yet, reading up on flask-login and other types of logging users in. 
Small database added via models.py but not able to import it in the same way i did in other projects. Help from TA's was great but in the end it didn't work the way I wanted to.
Decided to have the database in the app.py for simplicity.

Project has been set on hold for a few days in order to complete deadlines for BA Thesis.

*05-04-2021 - 11-04-2021*

Made a fully functioning database without parent-child relations because I wanted to keep it simple. 
Implemented:  
Users  
Worlds  
Locations  
Characters (no stats yet, and no relationship to users)  
Notes.  
Notes are added via Javascript, which took alot of work to make asynchronous.

*11-04-2021 - 02-05-2021*

These weeks had very slow progress with trying to figure out different aspects of:  
Flask Session,  
SqlAlchemy and reroutes,  
What Javascript to use.  
I decided to not add more functionality besides making worlds, locations, characters and notes for the progress I'm making is too slow.

*02-05-2021 - 09-05-2021*

Reworked database to include relationships via ForeignKeys.   
Took a couple of days to make that working completely.
Wish I had done that in the beginning. I realised a project like this should be very very well thought out before starting it.
I made too many mistakes in the beginning. Mainly picking Flask has cost me dearly.

*09-05-2021 - 16-05-2021*

Fixed all html pages to be more uniform.   
Switched to tile displays instead of Albums and gave it my own twist.  
Tried to fix navbar but due to too little time and incompetence I was not able to make it more stylish.  
Added a search bar to the navbar.  
Fixed the search route to display all queried items correctly.  
Added links to all search results.   
I decided to not add more features than this to keep the project simple.

*16-05-2021 - 21-05-2021*

Code cleanup.  
Added comments,  
Delete duplicate code or unnecessary loops,  
Updated README and DESIGN and PROCESS (should've done this during the project)  
Contemplating the averageness of this project. There's so much I should've done extra (friends, shareable locations and characters)
but every step took so long to take, and came with such hardship that I didn't have time for those things. Plus I didn't think of them at the beginning.
