# Programmeerproject

This project is dedicated to create a application which helps Tabletop RPG player in keeping their notes organised and readily available. 

How it works:
A user can create a profile and can:
* 1: Create worlds.
* 2: Join worlds.

**1. Create Worlds.**
    When a world is created they can add other users to those worlds as participants. 
    Then the Original creator (OG) can create Locations and Characters in this world.
    
**2. Join Worlds.**
    When a User joins a world they can view the locations and characters added by the OG and add notes to them. 
    Those notes are recorded on their own page, the location/character page and can be viewed by all participants and the OG.
    Planned Update: The user can create their own character in that world based on the 5e DnD rules.

Doing so this project is in line with other note taking apps like Evernote or more specifically Digital DM. 
This app will give the users a more simplified way of keeping tabs on their notes, whereas other apps try to do too much.

When a user has created a World they can create instances (Locations or Characters) to "fill" that world.
Users that have joined that world can view those intances and create notes which are visible for all users joining that world.

Users can also create a character belonging to themselves. This will be their Player Character and will act as their Avatar in that World.
